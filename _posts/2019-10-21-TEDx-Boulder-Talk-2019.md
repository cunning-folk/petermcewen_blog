Ok. This really is a talk about uncomfortable silences. I’ve been subjecting myself to these silences for over 20 years; you could say I am a connoisseur of silences.<!--more-->

Sitting without idly consuming is a creative moment. It is a moment I take a break from other people’s noise - a space where I can hear my own voice and yield to the fulfillment my human capacities.

Meditation isn’t just a series of uncomfortable silences that later yield to excitement. Meditation is an attention on that which supports us.

    <p>Gutenberg’s ideal would have been to make type indistinguishable from formal writing. So the goal of typography at first had nothing to do with type or design: it had everything to do with saving time. Producing multiple copies of books faster than they could be written was the point of typography: no more and no less.</p>

We can feel that the support of gravity working well. Autumn has spontaneously arrived. Plenty of oxygen to breathe. You don’t have to do anything to deserve any of that support. It’s already present. Relax into the reality that you’re already being supported. Feeling supported opens up an opportunity to notice freshness.

**_Freshness_** — I think, what we are looking for in our lives. And by freshness, I mean the direct experience of our life energy.

Compared to promises that pop culture meditation makes, just the simple practice of being aware, discomfort and all, is a hard sell.

People spend a lot of time and money to dissociate, and for good reason. Historically speaking, life on this planet has been a disturbing trial for most organisms.

When we look, we find that making the world non-threatening is not a sustainable strategy. Working with our mind is the more sustainable option. The relationship we have with our mind is challenging one. But it is the relationship.

Many people already have their minds made up that something is inherently missing and needs fixing.

This is a formula supported by marketing spin. There is something wrong with us, we can fix it, and then we will have a special credential.

This formula results in the adoption of a fantasy of invulnerability.
