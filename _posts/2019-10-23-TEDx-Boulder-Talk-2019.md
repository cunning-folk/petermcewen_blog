We recover to participation in what is already happening. We might discover that this field of present experience is a source of healing, problem solving and kindness. <!--more-->

We will also find disturbance in the present. Intense life energy. We tend to avoid disturbance at all costs. As children, this was a very intelligent strategy. But now we are grown ups and we can extend our capacity to experience intensity and still behave with kindness and wakefulness. In fact, planetary health is demanding this effort to engage compassionately.

This mind renders as unconstructed experience. Devoid of location. The mind’s sparkling and vivid refractions are juxtaposed onto our lives.

We may find that it is not the world we’re afraid of, it’s our own mind.

Even so, this moment is 100% fresh. Even our resistance can only be experienced in a fresh moment.

This fresh moment provides precision.

And I think we deserve to have a precise relationship to our lives. This sort of precision nurtures resilience and kindness. Freshness supporting sanity. Freshness supporting healthful dissent and personal accountability.

Ok, I think I just caught myself making marketing promises. It’s an easy thing to do!

Faced with a challenge, humans so easily regress to child-like thinking and behavior. Pop-culture meditation does not offer many tools to prevent these regressions.

We not only need to ‘take hold of our minds’ but also grow our willingness to return to our adult capacities when challenged. I like to think we can act with a regal attitude towards our frailties. We can invest attention in openness and, when necessary, pass sentence on the troublemaking aspects of our minds.

From this vantage point, tolerating uncertainty and intensity can be construed as a superpower. We’re responsible for the health of the inner realm. We alone are responsible for waking up, growing up and showing up.

To cultivate this attentional superpower,  it’s essential to understand that this effort goes against our biology much of the time. Our biology is not going anywhere. Fear and anxiety have been on this planet far longer than humans. We can't transcend our biology, but we can integrate it with our human capabilities.

It takes real fierceness to move against the tide of survival-level threat we often experience. We must challenge fear and panic by staying embodied and asking ourselves, ‘Is there a real threat in this moment?’

This is the royal practice of integration, of integrating the animal and the imaginal.

Final critique… Often meditators appropriate cultural habits at the expense of being present.

So the moment I’m sure you’ve all been waiting for.

What the hell is meditation good for? I’ve been pretty critical of the whole scene! Surely, we all start on this journey of uncomfortable silences to improve our experience.

On the positive side, working with your mind gives you the confidence to fully participate in your experience - resistance, discomfort and all.

Meditation supports the confidence that our lives are workable, that emotion is workable, and that anxiousness arises in myriad forms whether there is a ‘real’ threat, or not.

At the very least, we may find that we have conflicting feelings about dissolving chronic patterns of unhappiness and struggle. We may start to see our problems as a form of entertainment.

Viewed through the vantage point of freshness, we are presented with a choice. We can choose to indulge survival-level drama, or note that there is no immediate threat.

Why meditate? Because waking out of a trance is an incredible attainment.

If something feels like it is missing, maybe what is really missing is full participation in your experience.

Maybe the fantasies of peace and cessation that marketers push are what fuel our feeling of deficit.

Meditation will not ‘make you good’. You’re already good.

Enlightenment and meditation are not a manufactured achievements.

It is something we can notice right here, right now. Use your anxiousness, your fear, your self-critique as a prompt to remember the freshness of experience.

Catch yourself in the act of using a meditation formula and instead simply _return to the present moment_.
