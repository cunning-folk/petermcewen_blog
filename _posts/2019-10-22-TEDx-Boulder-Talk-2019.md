We want to live our best life, but who is telling us that? Who tells us how to do that? There seems to be a vacuum in how the west culturally frames meditation – a vacuum that marketers and app companies are happy to fill. <!--more--> The accompanying marketing often preys on our deep feelings of deficit. Pop culture’s ad messaging helps us find evidence of our shortcomings.

Sometimes we see hundreds of targeted ads in one browsing session. These are rough waters for an organism that has a brain that is shaped by language.

And as we all know, our attention has become equivalent to dollar signs. The more primitive the messaging, the more compelling the message seems.

One such message is ‘doing nothing’.  Ironically, a seductive form of productivity. Let’s all make sure and add ‘do nothing’ to our to-do list.

‘Doing nothing’ augmented with capitalism’s admonition to ‘be happy’ presents a very interesting cocktail: doing nothing turns into a pursuit. An effort to enjoy.   

There seems to be something fundamentally incompatible about this formula - are we doing nothing or are we creating new cultural vistas? The answer is not black and white. The answer, like everything on our planet, is complex.

The ad world eschews complexity in deference to reaching a broad audience. I think the ad world defines meditation as preventative medicine. I think a more accurate framing is that it is a practice that aides in our recovery and restoration.

The question is: what is it we are recovering to?

We recover to full participation in our immediate experience.

We recover to participation in what is already happening. We might discover that this field of present experience is a source of healing, problem solving and kindness.

We will also find disturbance in the present. Intense life energy. We tend to avoid disturbance at all costs. As children, this was a very intelligent strategy. But now we are grown ups and we can extend our capacity to experience intensity and still behave with kindness and wakefulness. In fact, planetary health is demanding this effort to engage compassionately.

This mind renders as unconstructed experience. Devoid of location. The mind’s sparkling and vivid refractions are juxtaposed onto our lives.

We may find that it is not the world we’re afraid of, it’s our own mind.

Even so, this moment is 100% fresh. Even our resistance can only be experienced in a fresh moment.

This fresh moment provides precision.

And I think we deserve to have a precise relationship to our lives. This sort of precision nurtures resilience and kindness. Freshness supporting sanity. Freshness supporting healthful dissent and personal accountability.

Ok, I think I just caught myself making marketing promises. It’s an easy thing to do!

Faced with a challenge, humans so easily regress to child-like thinking and behavior. Pop-culture meditation does not offer many tools to prevent these regressions.

We not only need to ‘take hold of our minds’ but also grow our willingness to return to our adult capacities when challenged. I like to think we can act with a regal attitude towards our frailties. We can invest attention in openness and, when necessary, pass sentence on the troublemaking aspects of our minds.

From this vantage point, tolerating uncertainty and intensity can be construed as a superpower. We’re responsible for the health of the inner realm. We alone are responsible for waking up, growing up and showing up.
