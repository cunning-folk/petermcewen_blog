## Get to know me


Peter is a design director and [editorial photographer](https://petermcewen.photos) who constructs design systems and brand identity work. Peter also teaches Product Design and Brand Design** at the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Despite all this, Peter still finds time for the very important practice of [doing nothing](https://thefield.us).

**Design Practice**

Peter has helped enterprise and startup orgs discover and articulate their design voice as a design manager, strategic partner, brand designer, and creative director.

Disciplined process augmented by playful inquiry yields an _innovative and functional design_.
