Peter McEwen wants you to be less busy. He is often uncomfortable, and thatâ€™s perfect.

In a society that prioritizes output, meditation and mindfulness practices are often conflated with self-optimization. Instead, we can view meditation as a tool that reveals our immediate experience - discomfort and all - as a reliable source of well-being and problem-solving.

Peter is the founder of [The Field](https://thefield.us), which offers training, community, and the demystification of basic contemplative practices. Peter's style of meditation instruction is focused through the lens of immediacy and unconditional kindness towards all of our experiencing. I love helping people who work in creative and technological fields balance work and family with sustaining a mindfulness practice that provides confidence in their essential sanity.

Peter is also a [designer](https://petermcewen.com) and [editorial photographer](https://petermcewen.photos) who helps enterprise and startup organizations discover and articulate their design voice as a design manager, strategic partner, brand designer, and creative director.

Peter also teaches product design and brand design at [ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/projects).

Despite all this, Peter still finds time for the very important practice of doing nothing. His goal is to use up this precious life with creativity and dignity.
