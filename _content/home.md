My name is Peter McEwen and I am an interplanetary envoy. Peter is a design director and editorial photographer who constructs design systems and brand identity work. Peter also teaches Product Design and Brand Design at the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Despite all this, Peter still finds time for the very important practice of doing nothing.
